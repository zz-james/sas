 <p>‘In the chaos after the death, when I felt so alone, so desperate and so dazed, it helped to read something that described a bit of what I was feeling and what was happening. It felt a little as though there were others out there who were by my side and would know what I was going through.’ Mike, whose partner died</p>

<p>‘I spent a large amount of time trying to ‘solve’ why my son had decided to take his life. I internalised all these feelings which made things worse and worse for me. I just wanted to curl up in a ball and let life pass me by. I ended up reaching crisis point and was desperately trying to escape from the permanent anguish I felt. It was at this point that I decided I needed to share how I felt. That has been the game changer. Since I started talking about what I feel I have found the strength to move forward.’ Dean, whose son died</p>

<p>‘So I have made a pact with myself, which some days I can stick to, and other days not, that I will focus on remembering with joy all the good times I enjoyed and not the guilt-laden “what ifs” that can’t bring me anything but pain.’ Amy, whose mother died</p>

<p>‘I feel sometimes that people define my mum’s life by her death. She’s stigmatised by the label “suicide”. If someone dies from cancer or a car crash they are not blamed, nor have their death held against them like a character flaw. But with suicide I felt I had to explain how kind, lovely and giving she was. How she wasn’t selfish, how she hadn’t done this for attention but because depression had robbed her of her will to live.’ Lucy, whose mother died</p>
